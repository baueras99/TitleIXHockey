The '''Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program''' represents [[Cornell University]] and participates in [[ECAC Hockey]].

==History==
The Cornell women's hockey program was started in 1971. It would only be in 1972 that the team would play its first game; it was a 4–3 victory over Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight games and lost four. In addition, the Big Red lost twice to the [[Brown Bears women's ice hockey|Pandas's]] program.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ivy50.com/womens/story.aspx?sid=2/22/2007   |title= Ivy Women’s Hockey|author=  |date= February 22, 2007  |work= |publisher= Ivy Women in Sports: profiles of women from the Ivy League’s history|accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref>

In 1976, Brown hosted the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. Cornell bested Brown, Princeton and Yale to win the tournament.

On March 7, 2010, sophomore Kendice Ogilvie beat Clarkson goaltender Lauren Dahm at 7:52 mark in overtime. With the victory, Cornell won its first ECAC Tournament, and earns its first trip to the NCAA Frozen Four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellbigred.com/news/2010/3/7/WICE_0307100425.aspx|title=ECAC HOCKEY CHAMPIONS!

On March 13, 2010, Cornell defeated the [[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey|Crimson]] by a score of 6–2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellbigred.com/news/2010/3/13/WICE_0313103301.aspx|title=Women's Hockey To Face Mercyhurst In NCAA Semifinals|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> to earn its first ever trip to the NCAA Frozen Four. At the 2010 Frozen Four championship game, Cornell goaltender Amanda Mazzotta set a record for most saves in an NCAA Championship game with 61 saves. The former record holder was Bulldog goaltender Patricia Sautter. She had the old record of 41 set in 2003.<ref>http://www.umdbulldogs.com/teams-womens-hockey.php?id=4999&page=news</ref>

On January 7 and 8, 2011, Cornell freshman goaltender Lauren Slebodnik earned two shutouts in her first two career starts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecachockey.com/women/2010-11/Weekly_Awards/Womens_Weekly_Awards_01_11.pdf|title=ECAC Hockey|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> On January 7, she made her NCAA debut by shutting out Yale by a 5–0 margin. With Cornell dressing just 12 skaters, she stopped all 23 Yale shots. The following night, Slebodnik shut out the [[Brown Bears women's ice hockey|Brown Bears]] by a 3–0 mark. Cornell only dressed 11 skaters for the game and she stopped all 15 shots.

In [[Jillian Saulnier]]'s college debut versus the [[Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey|Colgate Raiders]] on October 25, she netted four goals. In her first three career NCAA games, she registered ten points (seven goals, three assists), along with a +6 rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cornellbigred.com/news/2011/10/25/WICE_1025111921.aspx?path=whockey|title=Saulnier Notches Four Goals in First Career Game As Cornell Tops Colgate|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> Her four-goal night was the first for Cornell since [[Jessica Campbell (ice hockey)|Jessica Campbell]] scored four against Robert Morris in the second game of the 2010–11 season. She scored her first career goal when she was out on the Big Red's first power play of the game. In her next game versus the Yale Bulldogs, she registered one goal and two assists, while scoring two goals in her third game versus the Brown Bears squad. For the month of October 2011, she was tied for first in the ECAC in goals scored (while the other player appeared in eight games).<ref name="ecachockey.com">{{cite web|url=http://ecachockey.com/women/2011-12/Weekly_Releases/Women-s_Monly_Awards_110111.pdf|title=ECAC Hockey|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> In a game on November 1, 2011, the Cornell Big Red scored at least nine goals in one game for the third consecutive contest. It was senior captain Chelsea Karpenko's 100th career game, as Saulnier led all Big Red players with two goals and three assists in a 9–2 triumph over the [[Syracuse Orange women's ice hockey|Syracuse Orange]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cornellbigred.com/news/2011/11/1/WICE_1101113016.aspx|title=Women's Ice Hockey Scores Nine Goals For Third Consecutive Game In Blowout of Syracuse|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref>
